# A few words about me
All my life I was very well versed in computers, but I didnâ€™t even think to connect my life with programming. After graduating from high school, I entered the Belarusian Economic University(BSEU), thinking that I should be an accountant. However, after studying for a year, I realized that I still want to become a web developer. 
    
I completed my first year at BSEU, took the documents and applied to the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Electronics(BSUIR). And my life has changed. I devoted all my free time to programming, later I took courses on developing websites and applications. After completing the courses, I went to work at BSUIR and supported the main website of the university. However, I realized that my knowledge was not enough and began to learn other technologies.

I'm sure my perseverance will help me soon become a real Front-end developer and get a job in your company!
